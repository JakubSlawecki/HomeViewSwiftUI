Learning swiftUI I decided to make a similar view as in the Apple "App Store", It uses several animations and Scroll View. Maybe it will be useful for my other projects :)

Fun to try to do something similar, the only problem is adding gestures to scrollView in SwiftUI, when they add some missing elements, the effect will be better.
